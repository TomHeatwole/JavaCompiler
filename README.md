# JavaCompiler

I've never studied compilers but I'm going to try and write one for fun.

As of right now the plan is to ignore most of what Java can do. My goal is to get to a point where single-file main method programs can run.


## Usage

### Compiling to assembly
Coming soon.

### Assembling, Linking, and Running
`./assemble_link_run <name_of_x86_file>`

## Limitations
Although the list is far from complete, a list of limitations of this compiler will be stored in limitations.txt
